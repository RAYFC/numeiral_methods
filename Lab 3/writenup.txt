comments on ex5:
	We have opitions of polynomial interpolation or piecewise
interpolation in EX5. Also, for obj_pca, we can interpolate it or not.For my
polynomial setting,  piecewise interpolation may perform better, however,
there may be an unexpected error for the last few frames. When I delete 
the last few frames, it's better than polynomial interpolation   
(I've commented it out in my e5 code ).
